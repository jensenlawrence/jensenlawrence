## Hello! I'm Jensen.

I'm a planetary science PhD student in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/) at MIT. I work in [Prof. Richard Teague](https://richteague.github.io/)'s group, where my main research focus is planet formation and evolution. Additionally, I'm interested in planetary atmospheres, planetary surfaces, and exoplanet demographics. I also hope to use my time at EAPS to learn more about ways to combat the climate crisis.

I firmly believe that science should be more open source and accessible, so I try to properly document all of my research-related codes and make them publicly available here on my GitHub. As well, I occasionally pursue side projects (coding is one of my favourite skills that I learned in undergrad), and I upload my project codes here too. Feel free to browse my repos and check out my work!

You can learn more about me on my [website](https://jensenlawrence.github.io).
