## Hello! I'm Jensen.

I'm an incoming planetary science PhD student in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/) at MIT. I'll be joining [Prof. Richard Teague](https://richteague.github.io/)'s group, where my main research focus will be planet formation and evolution. Additionally, I'm interested in planetary climate systems, planetary habitability, and exoplanet detection and characterization. I also hope to use my time at EAPS to learn more about Earth's climate and how to combat the climate crisis.

Much of my research has a significant programming component, and I also pursue side projects for fun (coding is one of my favourite skills that I learned in undergrad). As well, I am a strong believer in making science more open source and accessible. As a result, I try to make a habit of properly documenting all my code and making is publicly available on GitHub. Feel free to browse my repos and check out my work!
