## Hello :wave: I'm Jensen.

I'm an incoming planetary science Ph.D. student in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/) at MIT. I'll be joining [Prof. Richard Teague](https://richteague.github.io/)'s group, where my main research focus will be planet formation and evolution. Additionally, I'm interested in planetary climate systems, planetary habitability, and exoplanet characterization. I also hope to use my time at EAPS to learn more about Earth's climate and how to combat the climate crisis.

Much of my research has a significant programming component, and I also pursue side projects for fun (coding is one of my favourite skills that I learned in undergrad). Feel free to browse my repos and check out my work! You can also learn more about me on my [website](jensenlawrence.github.io).
