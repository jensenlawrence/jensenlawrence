## Hello! I'm Jensen.

I'm a planetary science PhD student in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences](https://eaps.mit.edu/) at MIT. I work in the [Planet Formation Lab](https://pfl.mit.edu/) with Prof. Richard Teague, where we seek to understand how planetary systems form and evolve. Additionally, I'm interested in planetary surfaces and planetary atmospheres.

I believe that science should be open source and accessible, so I try to properly document all of my research-related codes and make them publicly available here on my GitHub. As well, I occasionally pursue side projects (coding is one of my favourite skills that I learned in undergrad), and I upload my project codes here too. Feel free to browse my repos and check out my work!

You can learn more about me on my [website](https://jensenlawrence.github.io).
